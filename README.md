**Stratified Regression in Target Encoding**

There are two types of files, one type which have TargetEncoder.py extension that are the files which targetencoder in scikit-learn applied to determine whether using stratification with k-fold cross-validation in target encoding while using targetencoder in scikit-learn for encoding categorical features improves various machine learning models. The other files are the files which GLMM encoder applied to encode categorical features.
For running the code you have to install python 3.11 or higher since the target_encoder package will not works in smaller python version. The dataset file contains all four datasets which have been used to examine our method. ALL for datasets have many numerical and categorical features with continuous target variable.
